Top questions
- Logout to SignInRootViewController segue hits the auto advance code in viewDidLoad. Is that expected?
- How to edit contents of scroll view outside the view window (it's currently cut off) -> Is the changing the view controller size the best way?
- Back to Welcome segue in create account or sign in flows hit auto advance code in viewDidLoad. Is that expected?
- Is there a way in storyboard to CRTL-click and drag and pan the storyboard while you are trying to connect something or is zooming out the best way?

Optional things done
- Added text fields for create account and sign in screens and added rudimentary validation to enable and disable the Create and Sign In buttons. For First and Last Name, it mains sure the fields are not empty. For Email, it validates email addresses inline and turns red if it's invalid and the field loses focus. For Password, it shows the password meter and validates on non empty passwords.'
- Added a detail view for Getting Started.pdf and you can favorite a file. If you do, it enables the favorites button and if you go to the Favorites tab, it shows the file. In the favorites tab, you can also view the file and if you unfavorite it, it disappears from the favorites tab. Also, if you sign out when you have favorites, the favorites will go away which is what the current product does.

TODOS
- Password strength
- Swipe tutorial
